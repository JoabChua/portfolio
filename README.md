# Portfolio Project in React

This is a simple project to showcase some of my hobby projects on web and mobile apps.

## Project Outline

This project is using React 16 and Bulma css framework. This website is hosted by Firebase Hosting. Most of the data here are static data.

## Updates as of Feb 2022

This project has been refreshed from React 16 to React 17, ditching away JSX and embracing TSX. Believing that Typescript is the gold standard moving forward for Javascript development.
